#initialize game

#print intro
#ask user for height, width and number of mines
#valid user input for those parameters
#initialize board based on user input

#start game loop
  #print board state (the board, how many mines exist, maybe time)

  #check if there are empty valid squares to move on

  #ask user for coordinates
  #and validate the move
    #squares that have already been cleared are not valid
    #coords that are out of bounds are not valid

  #process the move
    #if the square happens to be empty, clear the appropriate squares
    #else if coord contains a mine, print "YOU LOSE" and exit game loop
#end game loop
